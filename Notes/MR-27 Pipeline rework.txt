I want to be able to use different shaders at runtime so I need to be able to 
bind a different pipeline.
I'm thinking for now have a malloced vector of pipelines? Or maybe not..
I guess for now just trying to switch shaders will be good enough
--
after some reading seems like I should use a pipeline cache.. maybe for a start
just try to create a different pipeline and then try to implement the cache
--
current plan
1. when a button is pushed - create pipeline(store it somewhere) with derivatives
this will switch shaders
2. press other button switch back pipeline
3. implement some kind of profiling to compare what happens when i implement pipeline
cache
--okay finish tomorrow, try to create 2nd pipe and swit
i will try to create two pipelines at the start and then switch them

now draw two skulls with diferent shaders

bug - bad lighting. Then make everything nicer and with derivatives and caches
