Seems like for specular lighting we need a uniform for camera position to calculate
viewing angle so might aswell add the light parameter uniforms. 

Also currently wht I have is a non degrading point light
, should make it a directional light

Need to add light position and camera pos
Added light uniforms but forgot to add camera..

For some reason the values are not going through. Fixed

Now add the goshdarn camera uniforms..

Alright so we need to make sure we have the normals

I guess we don't need vertex colour with our current shader so it 
would be good enough to just replace the colour with normals
