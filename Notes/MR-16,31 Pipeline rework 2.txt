1. Upload Model
2. Load model
	2.1 create pipeline
	2.2 add pipeline to pipelines-in-use

--
after creating new model - check if we need to make a new pipeline
-- dont forget fallback
-- dont forget sampler set layout
-- dont forget to make stuff private

drawing -> bind pipeline
-- need Texture.cpp and Image.cpp very badly..
// samplers can be reused
!----- PUT SAMPLERS ESLEWHERE, DON'T RECREATE -----!
How do I do that? everything is intertwined.. Figure it out..
!!--- when creating texture it must be known if we will need to create new samplers!!
!!--- for now it will do to just recreate ---!!
all these samplers and descriptors that im having trouble with first will be
for default pipeline which will have only one texture

Pipelines should be in Scene -- dont forget to pass it to pipeline
end frame, clean up scene stuff(pipes)
Will let Models be a vector, because insertion will happen rarely. Will handle insert
methd myself
-- dont forget to pass pipeline index to model
Pipeline()
-- don't forgt - readFile should auto read from Shaders folder

camera should be in scene.
